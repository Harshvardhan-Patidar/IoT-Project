# IoT-Based Fuel Impurity and Theft Detection System ğŸš—ğŸ’¨  

## Project Overview  
This project is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to address two critical concerns for vehicle owners:  

1. **Fuel Impurity Detection**  
   - Identify impurities like ethanol and kerosene present in petrol.  
   - Leverage advanced sensors to detect the quality of fuel and ensure better engine performance.  

2. **Theft Detection**  
   - Real-time notifications sent to your smartphone in case of petrol theft from your vehicle.  
   - Stay updated and secure with instant alerts.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
  Track fuel quality and theft incidents in real time.  

- **Smartphone Notifications:**  
  Get instant updates directly on your smartphone.  

- **Cloud Integration:**  
  Store data securely on the cloud for future analysis and decision-making.  

- **Predictive Analysis:**  
  Use historical data to determine which fuel station provides the best quality petrol for your vehicle.     

## Benefits  
- Improved vehicle performance with better fuel quality.  
- Enhanced security against fuel theft.  
- Data-driven decision-making for fuel purchases.  

## Future Scope
